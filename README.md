**Subject:** A mask on each of us is a win for all of us.

It’s time to open up a new day of listening and mutual respect. While we are all different, there is an “us” in Austin.

We encourage everyone to wear a mask and help us prevent the spread of COVID-19. Our local businesses, medical professionals, and neighbors are counting on us.

We invite you to share this PSA with your own networks and on your personal social media. Together, let’s be that city of us.
